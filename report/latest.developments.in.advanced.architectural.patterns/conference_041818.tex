\section{Architectural design patterns}
Large enterprise needs software that scales with ever chaging and increasing needs of the business. Selecting the right architecture before diving into the actual work is crucial to the success of the application and enterprise. This section explores various architectural patterns used in the industry. The pros and cons will be discussed for each of the pattern.

\subsection{Layered architecture}
It is the most common architecture style, that organize similar modules into horizontal layers. The layers are independent of others and inteact using exported APIs. An application can be designed using any number of layers. The network protocol stack is a good example of layered architecture. The in upper layer is transmitted to lower layers using encapsulated packets. A layer don't have to know the inner working of other layer and communication happens through a set of APIs exposed by each layer. Another example of bussiness application, that is divided into presentation, logic and data tiers. Following of some of the benefits offered by this architecture.
\begin{itemize}
\item Layers can be developed and tested independently.
\item Changes made in one layer doesn't affect the other layer, hence maintainable.
\item Low coupling and high cohesion
\item Lower layers have no dependency on higher layer and hence reusable.
\end{itemize}

The disadvantages can be summarized as follow.
\begin{itemize}
\item A change to any component may trigger a redeployment of the entire application.
\item Each layer can have separate physical deployment or an entire application can be replicated. It is too coarse grained from deployment perspective.
\item Communication across layers can be a performance bottleneck for certain applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{client-server architecture}
It consists of a server and multiple clients. The server keeps listening to the client requests. The server responds to any new client requests i.e., provides a service to those clients.
E.g. the encryption key control server provides encryption keys to the requesting clients over network. This model is prone to denial of service attack. The scalability requires replicating the server components with load balancing, failover and failback mechanisms.
\subsection{Pipe and filter architecture} 
This approach is suitable for large applications that can be broken down to multiple steps. Each step refers to a filter. The filter applies a specific function to the data and can work asynchronously as well. The pipes refer to the connectors between these filters. The output of one filter serves as an input for the next filter on the pipeline. The common example is Unix pipes. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding a new step is easy by adding a new filter and adding it to existing pipe stream.
\item It is easier to reuse of filters doing generic actions.
\item Promotes concurrency of different filters do not depend on each other.
\item The errors gets propogated across the filters, which is a downside of this architecture.
\item A broken filter leads to a complete broken pipe.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peer to peer architecture}
A peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture consists of a decentralized network of peers i.e. nodes. Unline client-server architecture, a node in this architecture can act both as a server and a client.
The workload is split into small chunks that can be reassembled later, allowing peers to work simultaneously on a task. E.g. P2P file sharing, where a file is split into chunks that allows many chunks to be downloaded from diffrent peers at the same time.
\begin{itemize}
\item Need for centralized server is eliminated.
\item There is no single point of failure, unless the number of peers are too few.
\item The increase in number of peers can be handled easily i.e., scalable.
\item The model is prone to security issue, as an infected peer can affect the whole network.
\item Fairless garuntees are difficult to enforce as many leeches could benefit free riders.
\item Instant messaging, file sharing, collaboration apps use P2P architecture. E.g. Bitcoin, BitTorrent, napster etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event based architecture}
The callbacks mechanism describes this architecture well. It consists of source, listener, and a bus. The event source send a message i.e. an event on the bus to other component. The listener responds by performing some action. The components comminicate only via the event bus. The linux device driver interrupt handlers employ this mechanism. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Changing name or type of an even requires changes to the listener.
\item Too many event sources or listeners lead to bottleneck for the bus.
\item Following the control flow is difficult due to asynchronous nature of events.
\item The producer and consumer of the event need not be aware of each other allowing for loose coupling
\item Loose coupling makes it easy for a component to evolve independently.
\item Message passing over the bus introduce additional abstraction and may not be efficient.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpreter}
It consists of a program to be executed, an interpreter which runs such a program, program state and memory component required any storage needs. The interpreted languages like Awk, Perl, Python or Java are prime example of this architectural style of development.
\begin{itemize}
\item Program development becomes easy with the help of interpreter.
\item Allows portability across various platforms.
\item Debugging become easier.
\item An extra level of indirection makes execution slower.
\item Interpreter can gaurd against malicious instruction 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blackboard}
It is similar to boardroom where people solve the problem using a whiteboard. The component blackboard acts as a global information store. It allows various components to collaborate towards the final solution. The controller component monitors the blackboard and schedules individual knowledge sources. The knowledge sources are specialized workers with its own representation of the problem. The communication happens through the blackboard. The CAD software is an example of blackboard design.
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient scheduling of tasks and resource management across a distributed network.
\item Better suited when a problem can be split into multiple sub-problems.
\item Not always easy to break down a task into subproblems.
\item Everything is shared and can cause unwated information flows.
\item Controller design can become overly complex and unmaintainable.
\item Knowledge sources being independent, allows for reusability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
