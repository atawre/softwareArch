Maze - generate method implements facade

The generate method uses two boolean arrays i.e. hWall , vWall representing presence of horizontal/vertical walls.

hWalls = row*(column - 1)
vWalls = (row-1)*(column)

The position of wall in array represents it's position in grid.
Horitontal wall (i, j) is to the right of cell (i,j)
Vertical wall (i, j) is below the cell (i,j)

Not all grid components are represented as objects. That would create too many objects for an assignment purpose.
